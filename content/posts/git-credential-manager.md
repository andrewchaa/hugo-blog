# git credential manager

{% embed url="https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core" %}

I was pushing my commit to Azure DevOps git repo and it asked me my credential. I did and then it asked me again when I pushed my next commit. It kept asking on and on. I had to do something to sort it out. I googled it and came across this.
